    One of the most poplar games of 2016 is Battlefield 1 because how unusal the setting was and also they made
    a multiplayer mode with 64 people in it(that is very big for games back at that time). The setting was very unusal
    because their was few games that were based during World War 1 and Battlefield 1 put those games to shame. Also, the
    camapign of the game was very good because instead of follwing one main character through out the campiagn, they had 5
    main characters that had diffrent views of World War One.
